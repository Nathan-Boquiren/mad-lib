At first, I thought it was a glitch—or maybe I'd eaten too many {5}—but then it sent a selfie with a filter that made it look like a {6}.\n\nBy dinner, it had already posted three memes, joined a group chat called \"{7},\" and ordered a crate of {8} from an online store called \"SnailPrime.\" I caught it trying to DM my {9}, asking for tips on how to do a proper {10}.\n\nThen it started livestreaming. Viewers thought it was performance art. One even donated {11} to see it reenact a scene from \"{12}.\" My phone was blowing up faster than a {13} in a tumble dryer.\n\nEventually, the news picked it up, and now my pet is sponsored by {14} and signs autographs using a {15}. Meanwhile, I still can’t get a text back from my dentist.",

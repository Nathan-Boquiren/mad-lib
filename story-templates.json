At first, I thought it was a glitch—or maybe I'd eaten too many {5}—but then it sent a selfie with a filter that made it look like a {6}.\n\nBy dinner, it had already posted three memes, joined a group chat called \"{7},\" and ordered a crate of {8} from an online store called \"SnailPrime.\" I caught it trying to DM my {9}, asking for tips on how to do a proper {10}.\n\nThen it started livestreaming.
